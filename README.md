# How-do-Holidays-Affect-Retail-Sales-
Our overall goal for this project is to explore the relationship between the columns IsHoliday and Weekly_Sales. Moreover, we were interested in seeing how Store, Dept, Type, Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, and Unemployment separately affected this relationship. We wanted to ask questions such as, "What will weekly sales look like if it's a holiday or not a holiday for each store or department?" We aimed to look for any trends and correlations between sales and holidays, and between sales and holidays given a third variable.
